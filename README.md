Anti-entropy communication is a method of epidemic data dissemination.  This tool demonstrates anti-entropy data dissemination in a peer-to-peer architecture.  The tool has multiple hosts who communicate randomly, slowly synchronizing their values toward a distributed average.  The code is based on an algorithm described by Martin van Steen in his Distributed Systems book (version 2).

The code given here uses multiple threads to enable listening in the background and initiated communication with other nodes.

This is only the starter code with places left to fill in content.   The complete code is found in another repository.
